# NASty - a dumbnas project

NASty (v1) is a not-at-all-cheap and semi-nasty NAS constructed around a combination of a Raspberry Pi CM4, a PCIe switch, some PC components, and too many SSDs.

NASty (v2) is maybe marginally cheaper, but not by much, and is built around a standard Pi 5, dispensing with the PCIe switch since the RP1 provides USB 3 interfaces.
