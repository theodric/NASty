- 12W idle
- 200W base clock (boots slowly as a result)
- 2GHz peak clock
- no manual overvolt
- no force turbo - retains warranty!
- Dickson Industries CM1 heatsink

# Run as fast as firmware / board allows
arm_boost=1

#see also https://qengineering.eu/overclocking-the-raspberry-pi-4.html
#uncomment to overclock the arm. 700 MHz is the default. 2000 is safe on a pi4 with decent cooling.
## "Clocked at 200 MHz, your RPi consumes about 1.7 Watts."
arm_freq_min=200
## Seems to be quite stable at 2000 (2GHz) with the Dickson Industries CM1 heatsink
arm_freq=2000
## apparently not needed in the new firmware(?)
#over_voltage=5

# The gpu_freq command will set core_freq, h264_freq, isp_freq, v3d_freq and hevc_freq all together
# which drives the L2 cache and memory bus for higher performance.
# A value of 750 is the highest value weâ€™ve gotten after rigorous testing.
## js note: I only saw a 1.2% memory bench improvement at 750, so rolled back the overclock

#gpu_freq=750
